# ASimpleKalmanFilterWithR
An intuitive introduction and application of Kalman Filtering for economics using R


This document provides an intuitive and simple introduction to Kalman Filtering.


The document is organised as follows: the first section motivates the usage of a Kalman Filter in an economic context and reviews the related theory. In particular, it focuses on the key results and ideas behind it–as we shall see, the Kalman Filter’s key idea is in reality surprisingly easy to understand. The second section applies the Kalman Filter algorithm to an extremely simple (yet not trivial) state-space model characterised by an AR(1) process as the state equation. The idea behind this is to simplify as much as possible in order to focus on the key elements that will then reveal useful to understand more complex problems.


This document is mostly based on lecture Notes from Prof. Mark Watson (Princeton University) given as part of the program for Beginning Doctoral students in Economics in Gerzensee taught in March 2020 ((Watson
(2020)). The lecture notes are themselves heavily based on Hamilton (1995).
