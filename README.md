# A Simple Kalman Filter With R

- This repository provides an intuitive and simple introduction to Kalman Filtering. First, it reviews quickly the related theory and focuses on the key ideas behind the filter. Next, it provides a simple (yet not trivial) step-by-step application of Kalman Filtering implemented with R. 
- Two files are important: 1) ASimpleKF.Rmd that generates the document in html or pdf using RMarkdown and 2) R-Script/ASimpleKF.R which contains the related R-code.
